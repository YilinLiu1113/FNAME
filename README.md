# Face-Name Association Task 





The Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (FNAME) test has been identified as a useful tool to test for early signs of AD by capitalizing on its effect on associative memory.

We have created eight noble FNAME tests which include only face-name association using faces adopted from the Chicago face database. These FNAME tests can potentially be used in research to measure the progression of memory impairment in adults with MCI and AD. 

The test consists of an encoding phase and a retrieval phase. During the encoding phase, participants viewed the face-name pairs and were asked to memorize both the face and the name. Following a 5.5-second presentation of each face-name pair, participants were asked to rate the level of fit between the two stimuli on a 4-point scale using their keyboard, with 1 indicating a poor match and 4 indicating a good match. This strategy is designed to mplify associative memory encoding. Following the encoding phase, participants were presented with 36 pairs in total during the retrieval phase. The pairs in the retrieval phase consisted of 12 intact pairs, 12 recombined pairs, and an additional 12 novel pairs. Participants were asked to recall the face-name pairs they previously memorized during the encoding phase by categorizing the pairs presented in the retrieval phase as either “correct” (the
face is matched with the correct name) by pressing ‘1’ on their keyboard, “incorrect” (the face is matched with the incorrect name) by pressing ‘2’ on their keyboard, or “new” (both the face and name were not in the previous encoding phase) by pressing ‘3’ on their keyboard
